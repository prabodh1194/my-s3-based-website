                        I'm employing my <em>"skills"</em> as a software
                        engineer while being employed by D. E. Shaw India Pvt.
                        Ltd., Hyderabad, India.

                        Doesn't our intermediate program require us to choose
                        between one of these three. Well, now that I'm an
                        engineer, I need to decide what to do with my life.

                        My exposure to finance has been through my professional
                        life and the tax deduction section of my monthly
                        payslip. And hatred of the latter have exposed me to
                        outside world. It is an interesting journey that I want
                        to embark on and I'll let this blog do the talking.
