                    This is some place to collect thoughts about what I discover,
                    see and observe around me. This is the place which I believe
                    will motivate me to carry on doing the same.

                    I need a daily fix of code & caffeine. This blog is written in
                    <a href="//reactjs.org/"><em>ReactJS</em></a>
                    and my exercise to pick up this latest
                    <a href="//www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat"><em> JS beauty </em></a>
                    is what partially led to me start up this blog. I plan to take up
                    other tech topics soon. Probably once when I've made my peace with
                    ReactJS.

                    My endeavors to
                    <a href="//cleartax.in/s/income-tax-allowances-and-deductions">
                        <em> save on my income tax </em>
                    </a>
                    has sent me down the equity route. Thanks to multitude of blogs &
                    videos which I follow, my ideas are a mush. It's high time I start
                    recording them. Probably, I'll start researching better.
