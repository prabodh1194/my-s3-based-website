            I am finally figuring out how to use LLMs for my case. For starters, I am selecting a design problem statement to prototype using LLMs.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am going to parse Annual Reports of companies and index them. Idea is to send in general queries and understand which companies do what.
            </p>
            <p>
            For example, I want to figure out companies that are well positioned to take advantage of electronics component manufacturing in India.
            I will send in a query like <span className='rainbow'>"Which companies are well positioned to take advantage of electronics component manufacturing in India?"</span> and the LLM should return a list of companies that have mentioned this in their annual reports.

                At this point of time, I am aware of the following keywords:

                    <li><PinkEM>Prompt Engineering</PinkEM> - <span>A way to design prompts for LLMs to get the desired output</span></li>
                </ul>
